<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
We study, by means of simulations, the performance of the
shewhart method, the Cusum method, the Shiryaev-Roberts
method and the likelihood ratio method in the case when
the true shift differs from the shift for which the methods
are optimal. The comparisons are made with respect to some
measures of performance associated with power such as
probability of false alarm when the change occurs immediately,
expected delay of true alarm and predictive value of an alarm.<br>
