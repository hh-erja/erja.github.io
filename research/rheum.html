<font class="g4">Abstract</font><br>
Signs of symptoms of locomotor system disorders following acute
gastroenteritis seem much more common than previously known.
Those symptoms could spring from other bacteria than the known
arthritogenic. It would be of great value to detect the
<i>pathogenesis</i> of postinfectious locomotor symptoms.<br>
<br>
Whether the initial CRP value is pathological (CRP>10) or not,
is too blunt an instrument for judging a development towards
inflammatory joint disease. Perhaps a use of the longitudinal
data could fix this but in that case there is a possibility
that the mere development of arthritis itself directly causes
higher CRP values.<br>
<br>
For a new study we recommend:
<ul class="gg4">
<li type="square">testing wheter classical
reactive arthritogenic is predicted by very high initial CRP
values (e.g. CRP>100) to get conditions for constructing
judgement criteria regarding antibiotic treatment.</li>
<li type="square">measuring a <i>sequence</i>
of initial CRP (for instance at days 1,2,3,...,10). Such a
longitudinal material might make a major improvement of the
basis for statistical analysis and the prediction of soft
tissue disease.</li>
</ul>
Our study has merely closed in upon one possible predicting
factor, that is the CRP level. Also other factors can be examined.
Before any future attempts to longitudinally evaluate this
statistical material, problems such as
<ul class="gg4">
<li type="square">how to make the proper change in the time axis</li>
<li type="square">how to deal with different types of missing values</li>
<li type="square">what factors that are meaningful to be followed as
    predicting variables</li>
<li type="square">if any of the predicting variables, from a medical point
    of view, would be likely to be assumed as causing
    variables</li>
</ul>
must be satisfactorily solved. Until this has been properly done,
any further longitudinal statistical conclusions drawn from the
material must be regarded with the utmost caution. The snag with
the sample size of only 68 patients showing locomotor problems,
Of course still remains and so only large differences, within
this group, can be verified.<br>
