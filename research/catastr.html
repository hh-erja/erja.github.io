<font class="g4">Abstract</font><br>
For on-line detection of environmental catastrophes
spatial as well as temporal effects are crucial. Observations
of some substance are made at different locations
in space at discrete times. Mainly two spatial features are
considered: first, a situation where the observations made at
the same time but at different sites are correlated, and secondly,
a situation where the catastrophe originates from a source with
known position in space and then spreads, passing other known positions
as time passes. The first situation turns out to be a special case
of a previously studied situation in multivariate surveillance.
The second case is reduced to a univariate problem and a brief
evaluation of the Shewhart method, the Cusum method and the
Shiryaev-Roberts method is made. The theory is applied on the
case of surveillance of radiation. The suggested methods are
compared with the method presently in use in Sweden.<br>

an example of how a shift of radiation could
spread in case of an incident is considered. In the picture,
the shift process is illustrated. The distance between consecutive
dashed arcs corresponds to 6 hours assuming that the shift spreads
with 5 m/sec. If an incident should have its source in Ignalina
this would mean a certain order for the shift process: first
1. Hoburgen, then 2. Alunda. after a 24 hour period 3.
