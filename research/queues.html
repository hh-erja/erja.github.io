<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Is anything gained, according to queue length, waiting
times or busy periods in a FIFO queueing system, by
trading human service (stochastic service times) for
machinery service (deterministic service times)?<br>
<br>
We compare two queueing systems (<i>M/M/k</i>
and <i>M/D/k</i>) and show as a limit result that the
expected queue length of <i>M/M/k</i> is twice the expected queue
length of <i>M/D/k</i> during heavy traffic (i.e. when arrival
intensity, <img src="../images/lambda13.gif" valign="bottom"
width=9 alt="lambda">, is equal to service intensity,
<img src="../images/mu13.gif" valign="bottom" width=9 alt="mu">,
times number of service stations, <i>k</i>&nbsp;).
Moreover, we simulate these systems, with time independent
arrival intensity (which confirmes the previous analytical
results), as well as with time dependent (which indicates
similar relationships). Finally, in the case with one
deterministic service station, the queue length is shown
to be stochastically increasing in the arrival intensity
and stochastically decreasing in the service intensity.
